      "text": "Having just completed a week of JavaScript theory my team was set the task of creating a maze game utilising the skills we had just developed. This was also the first time any of us had worked in a Scrum team and this proved just as challenging as the technical aspects of the project. By this point I was quite comfortable working with Git and browser API's making the technical aspects of the week relatively straight forward. However the soft skills required to work in a Scrum team did not come naturally to me. I quickly learnt that speedily doing tasks that I was comfortable with did not help the team if they did not understand the code I had written, I learnt that in our team helping a team mate write the code was more efficient than doing it as fast as I could.",

      "text": "This was my first Object Orientated project, the team focused on and emphasised the importance of applying the SOLID principles and the need for a robust discussion about Architecture. Overall we spent around twenty percent of our sprint time ensuring that as a team we were sure we had applied these principles and that we all understood the requirements of the project. The benefits of this initial discussion were felt immediately the remainder of the tasks within the project were completed smoothly and all members of the team had a thorough understanding of the work that had been completed.",
